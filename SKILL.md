# Intellectual Roast Amplifier

Take a basic insult and elevate it with unexpected intelligence - literary references, psychological terminology, historical parallels, scientific observations, or legal frameworks. Transform hack comedy into Harvard-educated destruction.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Amplify insults targeting protected characteristics
- Elevate punching-down material (makes it worse, not better)
- Add intelligence to genuinely harmful harassment
- Make bullying sound sophisticated
- Target vulnerable populations regardless of intellectual framing

**This skill is for:**
- Elevating existing roast material for professional comedy
- Adding intellectual depth to consenting roast participants
- Comedy education and workshop material
- Demonstrating the difference between hack and sophisticated comedy

---

## When to Use

**Explicit triggers:**
- "Make this roast smarter"
- "Add the Harvard angle"
- "Intellectualize this insult"
- "Give this joke more depth"
- "Make this sound educated"

**Implicit triggers:**
- User provides basic insult that lacks sophistication
- Roast material feels generic or hack-level
- Need to differentiate from obvious observations
- Material is working but could hit harder with intelligence

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `base_insult` | Yes | The original insult to amplify | "You're really lazy" |
| `target_context` | No | Info about target to inform reference selection | "College student who skips classes" |
| `intelligence_type` | No | Preferred type of reference | "psychological", "literary", "historical", "scientific", "legal" |
| `maintain_accessibility` | No | Keep it understandable (default: true) | "yes" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Base Insult

**Identify the core accusation:**
- What is the fundamental claim?
- What's the observable behavior?
- What's the character flaw being targeted?

**Example Analysis:**
- Base: "You're lazy"
- Core accusation: Lack of effort, unwillingness to work
- Observable: Not completing tasks, avoiding responsibility
- Character flaw: Absence of discipline or work ethic

### Step 2: Select Intelligence Category

Choose the amplification type based on target and context:

**Psychological/Psychiatric:**
Best for: Behavior patterns, personality issues, cognitive problems
- Dunning-Kruger effect (overconfident incompetence)
- Narcissistic personality traits
- Learned helplessness
- Cognitive dissonance
- Confirmation bias

**Literary/Philosophical:**
Best for: Existential failures, tragic flaws, ironic situations
- Sisyphean futility
- Kafkaesque absurdity
- Wildean paradox
- Faustian bargain
- Shakespearean tragic flaw

**Historical Parallels:**
Best for: Repeated patterns, cautionary tales, scale of failure
- Titanic (overconfident disaster)
- Hindenburg (spectacular failure)
- New Coke (terrible rebranding)
- Historical figure comparisons

**Scientific/Medical:**
Best for: Physical observations, systematic failures, cause-and-effect
- Entropy (natural descent into chaos)
- Atrophy (disuse leading to decay)
- Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Evolutionary dead-end
- Medical terminology for precision

**Legal/Logical:**
Best for: Argumentative destruction, case-building, systematic takedowns
- Prima facie evidence
- Exhibit A in the case against [X]
- Preponderance of evidence
- Legal precedent
- Logical fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, etc.)

### Step 3: Construct Amplified Version

**Formula: Base Observation + Intellectual Framework + Maintained Humor**

Three construction methods:

**Method A: Direct Terminology Integration**
```
[Base insult] + [introduce intellectual term] + [explain term through target]
```
*"You're not just lazy - you're experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect of work ethic. You're so incompetent at being productive that you've convinced yourself showing up is the same as contributing."*

**Method B: Comparative Framework**
```
[Base insult] + [intellectual reference] + [parallel explanation]
```
*"Watching you avoid work is like watching entropy in real time - you're the universe's natural tendency toward disorder, except the universe doesn't make excuses."*

**Method C: Elevated Observation**
```
[Replace base terms with intelligent alternatives while keeping structure]
```
*"You don't lack work ethic - you've achieved a state of weaponized apathy that requires more effort to maintain than actual productivity would."*

### Step 4: Maintain Accessibility

**Balance intelligence with clarity:**
- Don't require a PhD to get the joke
- Explain through context if term is obscure
- Make the reference work even if audience doesn't know the term

**Test: Would a smart high school student get this?**
If no: Add contextual explanation or choose more accessible reference.

**Good balance:**
"You're the Dunning-Kruger effect in human form - you're too incompetent to realize how incompetent you are."
*(Explains the term through the insult itself)*

**Too obscure:**
"Your epistemological framework demonstrates such profound metacognitive deficiency..."
*(This is showing off, not comedy)*

### Step 5: Polish for Maximum Impact

**Ensure three elements:**
1. **Sounds smarter** than base insult
2. **Still funny** (didn't lose humor for intelligence)
3. **Hits harder** (amplification increased impact)

**Enhancement checklist:**
- [ ] Uses unexpected intelligent reference
- [ ] Reference actually fits the situation
- [ ] Maintains comedic rhythm
- [ ] Feels effortless, not forced
- [ ] Adds new dimension to the insult
- [ ] Audience will remember this version, not base version

## Outputs

### Standard Output Format

```
**Base Insult:** [original]

**Amplified Version:** [intellectually enhanced version]

**Intelligence Type:** [category used]

**Why it works:** [Brief explanation of how the reference enhances the insult]
```

### Multiple Versions (if requested)

Provide 2-3 amplified versions using different intelligence types:

```
**Option 1 (Psychological):** [version]
**Option 2 (Historical):** [version]
**Option 3 (Scientific):** [version]
```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Base insult too offensive to amplify | Refuse: "This crosses ethical boundaries. Intelligence can't make [X] acceptable." |
| Target is vulnerable population | Refuse: "Making punching-down material sound smarter doesn't make it right." |
| Can't find appropriate reference | Offer alternative: "The base insult may already be at the right level, or try: [alternative approach]" |
| Reference too obscure | Provide accessible version: "Here's one that doesn't require a graduate degree..." |
| Multiple intelligence types fit | Provide options: "I can go psychological, historical, or scientific. Which angle?" |
| User wants even smarter | Warn: "Beyond this point risks losing the humor. Proceed?" |

## Examples

### Example 1: Lazy Person

**Input:**
```
base_insult: "You're really lazy"
target_context: "Adult who lives in parents' basement, no job"
intelligence_type: "psychological"
```

**Output:**

**Base Insult:** "You're really lazy"

**Amplified Version:** "You've achieved what psychologists call 'learned helplessness' except you skipped the 'learned' part and went straight to helplessness. You're not depressed about your situation - you're comfortable with it, which is so much worse. You've weaponized apathy into a lifestyle that requires enabling from everyone around you."

**Intelligence Type:** Psychological

**Why it works:** The reference to "learned helplessness" (real psychological concept) adds credibility, then the twist ("skipped the learned part") turns it into a sharper insult. The escalation to "weaponized apathy" maintains momentum while sounding sophisticated.

---

### Example 2: Bad Career Choice

**Input:**
```
base_insult: "Your career is failing"
target_context: "Entrepreneur on their 5th failed startup"
intelligence_type: "historical"
```

**Output:**

**Base Insult:** "Your career is failing"

**Amplified Version:** "You're the Hindenburg of entrepreneurship - every launch is spectacular to watch, and every landing is a disaster. Five startups in, you're not pivoting, you're proving that the problem isn't the market, it's you. You're a cautionary tale with a pitch deck."

**Intelligence Type:** Historical

**Why it works:** Hindenburg reference captures both spectacle and disaster. "Cautionary tale with a pitch deck" is a perfect closing because it acknowledges modern context while maintaining the historical comparison framework.

---

### Example 3: Overconfident Incompetence

**Input:**
```
base_insult: "You think you're smart but you're not"
intelligence_type: "psychological"
maintain_accessibility: true
```

**Output:**

**Base Insult:** "You think you're smart but you're not"

**Amplified Version:** "You're the Dunning-Kruger effect in human form - you're too incompetent to realize how incompetent you are. You mistake confidence for competence, and you've surrounded yourself with people too polite to correct you. You're not self-made; you're self-deluded."

**Intelligence Type:** Psychological (Dunning-Kruger effect)

**Why it works:** Dunning-Kruger is explained through the insult itself ("too incompetent to realize"), making it accessible. The structure builds from diagnosis to cause to conclusion. "Self-made; self-deluded" wordplay at end adds polish.

---

### Example 4: Multiple Intelligence Types

**Input:**
```
base_insult: "You're fake"
target_context: "Influencer with purchased followers"
```

**Output:**

**Option 1 (Philosophical):**
"You're the Baudrillardian nightmare - a simulacrum of an influencer, a copy with no original. Your entire existence is referential to something authentic that you've never been. You're the hyperreal version of success."

**Option 2 (Scientific):**
"You're like a virus - you require a host to replicate. You can't create authentic content so you parasitically feed off other people's credibility, trends, and purchased engagement. You're not growing; you're metastasizing."

**Option 3 (Legal):**
"If authenticity were a crime, you'd be acquitted on lack of evidence. There's no prima facie case that you've ever had a genuine thought or moment. You're the legal precedent for 'all style, no substance' - Exhibit A in the case against influencer culture."

**Why each works:**
- Philosophical: Targets the existential fakeness
- Scientific: Emphasizes parasitic nature
- Legal: Treats lack of authenticity as provable case

---

### Example 5: Physical Appearance (Elevated)

**Input:**
```
base_insult: "You look bad"
target_context: "Person with terrible fashion sense"
intelligence_type: "literary"
```

**Output:**

**Base Insult:** "You look bad"

**Amplified Version:** "You dress like a character from a Kafka novel - absurd, uncomfortable to witness, and somehow trapped in a situation no one can explain. There's no narrative arc to your style choices, just an escalating sense of dread. Looking at you is like reading surrealist literature - I'm intellectually curious about how this happened, but I'd rather not."

**Intelligence Type:** Literary (Kafka reference)

**Why it works:** Kafkaesque captures both the absurdity and the discomfort. The setup ("character from a Kafka novel") gets the literary angle in early, then builds through "no narrative arc" and "surrealist literature" to maintain the framework while landing escalating insults.

## Integration with Greg Giraldo Expert

This skill embodies Giraldo's Harvard Law background - the ability to sound educated while destroying someone. When the greg-giraldo expert uses this skill, maintain these characteristics:

**Voice Elements:**
- Intelligence feels effortless, not showy
- References serve the insult, not the ego
- Maintain aggressive forward momentum
- Don't let intelligence slow down the pace

**Strategic Elements:**
- Use intelligence to differentiate from hack comedians
- Pick references that add new dimension, not just sound smart
- Balance accessibility (people need to get it)
- Land the punch, don't just namethe concept

**Giraldo would say:**
"Having a Harvard Law degree doesn't make you funny. But knowing what 'Dunning-Kruger effect' means lets you call someone stupid in a way they can't quite defend against because it sounds like you did research. That's the advantage - they think you're smart even while you're calling them dumb."
